Please pardon the dust as much less organizational and design work went into the infrastructure of these tests. Two notes: first, bytes.c pairs with ENT, ENT ships with a Makefile, and bytes.c is simply gcc bytes.c -o bytes. In case you'd like to run a reproduction of the full test suite, please message me for guidance.

Second, while pgs achieves parity with both urandom and rdrand sources of entropy in ENT, I went to great pains to flesh out a trie-based novel verification process. This algorithm attempts to measure autocorrelation in a bit stream one byte at a time, so that (on todays hardware) every sliding window of 24 bits progressed by 8 bits in a multi-gigabyte bitstream can be checked for autocorrelation in reasonable time. You can see the test run that achieved substantial throughput gains over rdrand while maintaining statistical independence and noncorrelation in the root README.

A final note, these results have not yet been verified by any third party, and I want to stress that Intel has access to raw hardware sources of entropy which pgs only hopes to approximate through clever use of the cycle counter. At the same time, there is no slight of hand here. The raw entropy is generated in a feedback loop between the non-deterministic nop loop and subsequent counter calls â€” the rest of pgs is squeezing the most lifetime out of those bits as possible while whitening the output.
